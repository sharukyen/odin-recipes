    <br>Add a little more garlic and cut back on the pepper is advised. It's fairly easy to make, excellent flavor, and a crowd pleaser.</p1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>½ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ cup milk</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded thin</li>
    <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking dish.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking water.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook onion in oil until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for an additional 30 seconds. Stir in tomato sauce and tomato paste and cook until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Add cream and Parmesan cheese. Season with sugar, salt, and pepper.</li>
    <li>Stir some of the reserved pasta water into sauce and add cooked penne. Remove from the heat and stir in cherry tomatoes, 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese, and basil. Add more pasta water if needed to reach desired consistency. Pour penne mixture into the prepared baking dish and cover with remaining mozzarella cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.</li>
</ol>
